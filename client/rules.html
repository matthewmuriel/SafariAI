                Not all AI models are built the same. The AI modelâ€™s response varies based on the data it was trained on. In this game you will interact with <b>two</b> AI models we trained using these animal cards.
            </p>
            <p class="introp">
                Each AI was trained on different sets of cards and has different animal spotting capabilities. The AI models can only recognize the cards they were trained on and it's up to you to figure out which AI can recognize the cards you have.
            </p>
            <p class="introp">
                The cards are divided into two sets:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="introp"><span class="emph" id="savannahstyle">Savannah Set:</span> Lion, Zebra, and Rhino</li>
                <li class="introp"><span class="emph" id="foreststyle">Forest Set:</span> Tiger,Horse ,and Pig</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p class="introp">
                On the next page, you can show the AI models the cards and see what animals they can recognize. Good luck!
            </p>
            <p class="introp">
                <span class="emph" id="tipstyle">Tip 1: </span> Be sure to show the AI the cards one at a time, as they have a hard time spotting multiple animals at once.
                <br>
                <span class="emph" id="tipstyle">Tip 2:</span> Be sure to show both AI models the same cards to see what animal they think it is.
